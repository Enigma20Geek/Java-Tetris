# Java-Tetris

This is Java implementation of classic game Tetris.

The Game includes all functionalities from original game like showing next shape and holding a shape. I also added Highscores, vintage audios, clear animations and dialogue boxes.

I used Java Swing Library for GUI and threads for smoother experience. I hope you like it.;)

Controls:<br/>
A : Move left<br/>
D : Move right<br/>
S(Hold) : Move down faster<br/>
Space : Rotate shape<br/>
H : Hold shape<br/>
